            "sent1": "The protostomes, like arthropods and mollusks, have mouths that form first in their early stages.",
            "sent2": "Scientists study protostomes to understand how their mouths develop before their anuses.",
            "sent3": "The protostomes had a race to see which one could develop its mouth first - it was quite a competition!",
            "sent4": "In the world of protostomes, being the first to have a mouth can mean the difference between survival and extinction.",
            "sent5": "The protostomes' unique feature of mouth-first development sets them apart from other invertebrates."
